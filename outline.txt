Outline

The project consists of at least two devices, there could be more, and the code should be made to handle more
than 1 security camera. The devices are a Raspberry Pi 4 that will handle data storage and act as a server
to access said data; the other device is a Raspberry Pi Zero that will connect to the Raspberry Pi 4 via WiFi
, in a closed SCP between the two. I have to reaserch how this can be accomplished. The Pi Zero will
act as the security camera, recording videos in chucks of 10-30 minutes, depending on configuration. Then these
videos will be sent via SCP, or alterantively, FTP to the Raspberry Pi server. On both devices these videos will
be kept until a certain amount of space is filled by them. Example: A 500GB partition dedicated for this fills
up then the oldest video will be deleted to make space for the new video and so on.
Then this videos will be accessible via Apache2 server, with a login username and password, only for viewing,
copying, downloading, etc. will only be done directly at the server.

Project Progression
1. Python Script for recording 10-30 minute videos
2. Python Script for data handling of videos
3. Script for sharing the videos between the two devices using SCP
4. Python Script for data handling at server
5. Configure server

Basic Program Logic
1. Pi Zero Records Video
2. Pi Zero Checks Storage
3. Pi Zero sends video to R. Pi over B. SCP
4. R. Pi stores videos and check Storage
5. Videos can be viewed via Apache2 server


Outline of Python Script for Recording Videos

Program description: the script stars the camera and records a 10 - 30 minute video, ends the video and saves
it to the desired path.
